            <p class="">Powershop sprung to life in 2009, backed by Meridian Energy. We focused on making shopping for electricity easy and enjoyable, and created the tools people need to understand how much power they use, giving them the control to lower their bills. It worked. Today our Wellington headquarters are bursting at the seams, our Customer Service Centre is adding vibrancy to the rural Wairarapa township of Masterton and we have a thriving frontier in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

            <h2 class="">Who's the boss?</h2>
            <p>Ari Sargent has been working in the power industry for over twenty years. As an executive on the wholesale side, he used to wonder why things had to be so complicated for power users â€“ indecipherable bills combined with complicated tariffs and contracts was often followed up with frustratingly unresponsive customer service.</p>
            <p>So setting up Powershop was a way for Ari to use all his industry knowledge and combine it with his inner technology geek, to make things easier for electricity customers.</p>
