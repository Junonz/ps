            <p><strong>Simple Saver</strong> buys about a week’s worth of power at a super discounted ratereduced price every month. The Simple Saver discount starts off at 20% in your first year then increases by 1% each year you’re with us, reaching a maximum of 25% after five years.</p>
            <p>Our customers tell us the more they know about their electricity usage the more they save power and money.</p>
            <p>We developed Simple Saver to reward all our customers for checking their Powershop account at least once a month and help them save.</p>

            <p>If you&rsquo;ve purchased Simple Saver through the banner on your weekly Power Update email, payment is usually scheduled for three days later. We'll send you an email reminding you of the amount and when it will be taken from your bank account. Just like our usual refund process, you've got 48 hours to cancel the transaction.</p>
            <p>Sometimes we&rsquo;ll need to deal with payment a little differently. We&rsquo;ll always let you know when we&rsquo;re planning to take payment and anything else you need to do by email.</p>
